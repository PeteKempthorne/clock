# Clock in/out system

This is a project I had to do for an interview once. I was asked to create and clock in and out system for employees that would use a 4 digit code. System includes a database which stores user data and the times they clock in and out on specific dates. 
There is also a reports page which shows how many times employees have been clocking in or out late.
